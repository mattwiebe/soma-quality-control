# Soma Quality Control

A child theme for Spencer Finnell’s [Quality Control](http://getqualitycontrol.com/) WordPress theme.

Other than having my logo, here’s what it currently does:

* automatically creates a sane set of States on activation (with appropriate default colours)
* automatically creates an "Add Ticket" page on activation
* makes the colour scheme high enough contrast to be readable

Some possible future features:

* assign a ticket to someone
* notifications via checking users rather than entering email addresses


## Changelog

### 0.1

* Initial Release

### 0.2

* Add ability to set persistent notifications among blog authors
